## Code review

- No typing or docstring
- good code architecture
- event.py too long and not modular enough, unleash OOP potential next time
- don't include pycache in git repo next time add it in gitignore
- some explanation about the templates would have been good as well

This is a very good project, clean and complete but next time please improve the documentation of your code! It really makes the difference. But good job! :fire:
